__[Association between extreme rainfall and acute respiratory infection among children under-5 years in sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, 2006–2020](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/13/4/e071874.full.pdf)__

In this paper, the authors used CHIRPS as an environmental variable and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) cross-sectional data to investigate the acute respiratory infection with rainfall. However, no significant relation between the two was found except for Nigeria. The authors speculate that "Major flooding due to extreme rainfall reported across Nigeria in August 2018 resulted in large-scale population displacement. Indeed, the period of this event overlapped with the period from which DHS data in Nigeria were obtained. Flooding can increase respiratory fungal or polymicrobial infections by increasing inhalational exposure to these microorganisms under wet and humid conditions. 5 In some cases, increased transmission of ARI can occur from overcrowding in shelters after disasters"

# Flood and health risk

__[Health Risks of Flood Disasters](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/9/1450/4945455?login=false)__

This article discuessed potential health risks aftermath of a flood event. It mentioned the time lag between flood event and those diseases.

Immediate  
 Drowning  
 Trauma  
 Hypothermia  
 Electrocution  
 Carbon monoxide poisoning  
Early (<10 d after event)  
 Cutaneous infection  
 Aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia  
 Viral respiratory infections  
 Gastroenteritis  
Late (>10 d after event)  
 Leptospirosis  
 Mosquito-borne illnesses  
 Cutaneous infection from atypical organisms (fungi, mycobacteria)  
 Hepatitis A or E virus infection  
 Mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder and depression  
 Management of chronic disease

 This article comprehensively discussed infectious diseases outbreak associated with climate extremes such as flooding. They articulated the conditions that are conducive for disease outbreak.

In the multivariable models, increased number of new cases of acute hepatitis A, acute hepatitis E, dengue, malaria, measles, meningitis, typhoid and paratyphoid, tuberculosis, and upper respiratory infections were significantly correlated with the longer duration of floods (all p < 0.05). Increased lasting days of flooding were associated with increased number of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections (0.173%), measles (0.126%), typhoid and paratyphoid (0.043%), tetanus (0.245%), and tuberculosis (0.154%, all p < 0.05).

This article, the authors used emergency visit data to explore the relation between floods and health records. Some boosted numbers of diseases / injuries are shown below.
